# WORK IN PROGRESS

A highly modular structure based on <a href="https://github.com/salsita/redux-elm">redux-elm</a> (Elm architecture for Redux) and <a href="https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate">react-boilerplate</a> (most popular Redux foundation).

## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Ultimate modularization</dt>
  <dd>Thanks to Elm Architecture create easily manageable and reusable containers which builds your App.</dd>

  <dt><strike>Quick scaffolding</strike> <b>(work in progress)</b></dt>
  <dd><strike>Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!</strike></dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more, today.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>
  <dd>Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible with <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux">react-router-redux</a>.</dd>

  <dt>Offline-first</dt>
  <dd>The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.</dd>

  <dt>Managable form state</dt>
  <dd>Creating complex forms was never been easier. The best way to manage your form state in Redux is <a href="https://github.com/erikras/redux-form">redux-form</a>.</dd>
</dl>

But wait... there's more!

  - *The best test setup:* Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
    changes. (Seen a react app with 99% test coverage before?)
  - *Native web app:* Your app's new home? The home screen of your users' phones.
  - *The fastest fonts:* Say goodbye to vacant text.
  - *Stay fast*: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
    line!
  - *Catch problems:* AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
    tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.
